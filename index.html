    <h1>Happy birthday okuu💫</h1>
    <p>
      Happy birthday Bestie 🥳🥳💞. Wase the word OKU in japanese means the inner or deep part of something and calling u OKU means ur my "Inner person" , someone very close to my heart.Happy birthday yrr tum hamesa khush raho , ur so adorable , so so cute..Just be happy,stay calm.U can count on me i'm always here, whenever u feel like it call me,  text me , blast my phone , teri marji [wase i know u already do this, batane ka jarurat nii hai] ..I love u so so much🫂🫂..This gift is my effort to put a smile on ur face and to make u feel special which i hopped i did. I hope safely reach kr gyaa hoo, wase i couriered it on 30 September because i feared late na ho jaye , kyuki beech me sat , sun tha and also festive season so i spent the whole night of 29sep making this because i really wanted to make something special, u mean a lot to me, love u bae🥹🥹.It's ur 18th birthday and tumhari phutti kismat toh dekho next day test🥲🥲. I hope padh li ho , ur chill nd serious now, right? That's my girl.


Wanna know somthing , don't u think bracelet box doesn't exactly fit? Like ho skta hai niche kuch ho. Remove the padding(its glued btw) and check the bottom of the box, there's a surprise for u🤫😁.
Agge ka check krne ke baad hi padhna.

I hope u got it. Iske do piece hai[sun and moon] the second[moon] is with me. I gave u the sun because u light up my world even from a far. I think maine bas negative aspects bataye haii mere 11, 12th ke but lets lighten up the mood, u know how dull life is for a jee aspirant(especially ppl like me jo 11th se suru kiye hai), its not very happening, don't get me wrong i liked it(the thrill of solving questions , the fun in learning)..but then u came along , we again started talking in class 12 and let me tell u those calls, were a source of happiness for me..u wouldn't believe it but in class 12 around October i think i used to wait for ur call every evening and bht baar hua tha kii i didn't slept in the afternoon  not only because ki mujhe padhna haii but also kyuki if i did i would miss ur call(if u did call that day). Then the day before my JEE mains first attempt (21 January night), u called me..That time i was alone in my hotel room , in pitch darkness , the only sound being of my own heart, beating so fast i thought i would die. But then suddenly after a month(i guess) u called me , made me laugh and during the call i felt calm , i forgot mera kal JEE hai[woh alag baat hai after the call , i again wasn't able to sleep bcz of my anxiety 😂]. Ur my SUN, i hope that little keychain would remind u of me , abt how much i care abt u and how much i love u. Make sure to bring it with u the next time we meet.<br>
