    <button class="accordion">💌 Memories & Calls</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I hope u got it. Iske do piece hai[sun and moon] the second[moon] is with me. I gave u the sun because u light up my world even from a far. I think maine bas negative aspects bataye haii mere 11, 12th ke but lets lighten up the mood, u know how dull life is for a jee aspirant(especially ppl like me jo 11th se suru kiye hai), its not very happening, don't get me wrong i liked it(the thrill of solving questions , the fun in learning)..but then u came along , we again started talking in class 12 and let me tell u those calls, were a source of happiness for me..u wouldn't believe it but in class 12 around October i think i used to wait for ur call every evening and bht baar hua tha kii i didn't slept in the afternoon  not only because ki mujhe padhna haii but also kyuki if i did i would miss ur call(if u did call that day). Then the day before my JEE mains first attempt (21 January night), u called me..That time i was alone in my hotel room , in pitch darkness , the only sound being of my own heart, beating so fast i thought i would die. But then suddenly after a month(i guess) u called me , made me laugh and during the call i felt calm , i forgot mera kal JEE hai[woh alag baat hai after the call , i again wasn't able to sleep bcz of my anxiety 😂]. Ur my SUN, i hope that little keychain would remind u of me , abt how much i care abt u and how much i love u. Make sure to bring it with u the next time we meet.</p>
